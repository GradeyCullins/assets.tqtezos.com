## Introduction

A _money stream_ is a series of payments at regular intervals, such as a salary,
subscription, or other contractual disbursement.

The [_Vesting Contract_](https://github.com/tqtezos/vesting-contract) represents
an on-chain stream of Tez to a fixed address: the amount of available funds is
updated each second and anyone may vest available funds to the target address.

An example of the Vesting Contract may be found [on Edo2Net](https://better-call.dev/edo2net/KT1VdxSaoxxwBb7s9ZWDCbvR4NN54qfkwE1Q/operations).

### Use Cases

- Salaries
- Grants
  * Fund sub-projects over time
- Subscriptions
  * Content creation
  * Rent
  * Parking
  * CDPs
- Contracts
  * Consultancies
  * Vendors
- "Reversible" fundraising: introduced [at Devcon4 by @frozeman](https://cryptoindia.io/lukso-ama-recap/),
  investors' funds are held in streaming contracts and returned as the project evolves.

## Vesting Contract

The Vesting Contract holds Tez and periodically allows some of them to be
transferred to a fixed address, i.e. "_vested_":

```haskell
parameter (or (option %setDelegate key_hash)
              (nat %vest))
```

In particular, anyone may call `vest` with `(n %nat)`, transferring `n ticks`
worth of funds to the target `address`, or failing if `n ticks` have not passed
since the stream began.

The number of tokens that may be transferred at a given time is specified by a
"_vesting schedule_", which includes:
- `(start_time %timestamp)`: When the vesting begins
- `(nat %seconds_per_tick)`: The time period between allowing more Tez is a `tick`
- `(nat %mutez_per_tick)`: The number of additional `mutez` that may be vested
  each tick after `start_time`

### Vesting Schedule Example

Suppose we originate the contract with `60 mutez` and then set:
- `timestamp := now`
- `seconds_per_tick := 60`
- `mutez_per_tick := 1`

Then we can have the following scenarios:

- One minute after origination, anyone may trigger the flush of `1 mutez`.
- If no one flushes the contract after origination, `10 minutes` later,
  anyone may trigger the flush of _up to_ `10 mutez`.
- If the maximum number is flushed `5 minutes` after origination (`5 mutez`),
  anyone may flush up to `10 mutez` `10 minutes` later
- One hour (`60 minutes`) after origination, the entire balance of the contract may be flushed.


### Setting Up

#### Tezos-client

Follow instructions in [Client Setup](/docs/setup/1-tezos-client) to set up
  `tezos-client` and create a test network wallet with two addresses.

#### Originate and Use

##### Storage

```ocaml
Pair (Pair target_address
           delegate_admin)
     (Pair vested_ticks
           (Pair start_time
                 (Pair seconds_per_tick
                       mutez_per_tick)))
```

- `(address %target_address)`: The `address` that Tez are vested to
- `(address %delegate_admin)`: The `address` that may call `setDelegate`
- `(nat %vested_ticks)`: The number of ticks already transferred (i.e. `0` at origination)
- `(start_time %timestamp)`: When the vesting begins
- `(nat %seconds_per_tick)`: The number of seconds between allowing more Tez, i.e. one `tick`
- `(nat %mutez_per_tick)`: The number of additional `mutez` that may be vested
  each tick after `start_time`

We use the following storage values:

```bash
TARGET_ADDRESS="tz1bDCu64RmcpWahdn9bWrDMi6cu7mXZynHm"
DELEGATE_ADMIN_ADDRESS="tz1QS8VYYVDjv7iReBzXeheL6x63A1oATTj8"
START_TIME="$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"
SECONDS_PER_TICK=30
MUTEZ_PER_TICK=1
```

Replace `TARGET_ADDRESS` and `DELEGATE_ADMIN_ADDRESS` with your two addresses
from the [Client Setup](/docs/setup/1-tezos-client).

##### Use

###### Vesting

To vest some Tez, submit the number of ticks to the `vest` entrypoint.

Submitting too many ticks will error:

```bash
$ tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from tz1QS8VYYVDjv7iReBzXeheL6x63A1oATTj8 to $VESTING_TEZ \
  --entrypoint vest --arg 100

###### Setting The Delegate

To (un)set the delegate, call `setDelegate` as the `delegate_admin`.

Here we unset the delegate by submitting `None` for the `arg`ument. The delegate
may be set to `delegate_address` by submitting `Some delegate_address` instead.

NOTE: This contract does not have a `(unit %default)` entrypoint, which is
expected to receive Tez from delegators. One could:
- Add a `(unit %default)`, e.g. using the [`vesting_tez` LIGO module](https://github.com/tqtezos/vesting-contract/tree/master/ligo)
- Arrange for delegation rewards to be sent by vesting `0 ticks` or to another `address`

```bash
$ tezos-client --wait none transfer 0 from $DELEGATE_ADMIN_ADDRESS to $VESTING_TEZ \
  --entrypoint setDelegate --arg None
