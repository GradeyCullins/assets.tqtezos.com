To start with we'll download and install tezos-client and create a couple of
test wallets. We'll use
[tezos-client](https://tezos.gitlab.io/api/cli-commands.html) - a command line
interface to Tezos.

## Install

### Mac OS

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```shell
$ brew tap tqtezos/homebrew-tq https://github.com/tqtezos/homebrew-tq.git
$ brew install tezos
```

### Linux (64-bit)

A quick and easy way to get tezos-client running on Linux is to download the
latest `tezos-client` binary, make it executable, and put it somewhere in your
path. Alternatively you can add a package repository for your distribution, and
install it from there. Using a package is a good idea for production systems as
it automates the installation and allow easy updates.


#### Option 1:  Install the binary

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/serokell/tezos-packaging/releases/latest/download/tezos-client
$ chmod +x tezos-client
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
$ mv tezos-client $HOME/.local/bin
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> $HOME/.bashrc
$ source $HOME/.bashrc
```

> Note if the `Error` message `Cannot find zcash params in any of... ` appears
> please download and run [fetch-params](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcash/zcash/master/zcutil/fetch-params.sh).
> This script downloads zcash-params to $HOME/.zcash-params.


#### Option 2:  Using packages on Ubuntu or Fedora
For more ways to install on Linux see [tezos-packaging
project](https://github.com/serokell/tezos-packaging)

### Windows

Install one of Linux distributions using  [Windows Subsystem for Linux
(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04
LTS) and follow instructions for Linux.

## Configure

We'll configure `tezos-client` to use a public test network Tezos node. We do
that by specifying the address of the server with the `-A` option followed by
the server address. -S enables TLS encryption to the server, and -P specifies
the port, 443.  The final part of the command, `config update` will update the
configuration saved in $HOME/.tezos-client/config with the settings we've just
specified.


```shell
$ tezos-client -A rpcalpha.tzbeta.net -S -P 443 config update
```
[//]: # ( TODO: In the interests of keeping things simple, I'd suggest leaving
the following option out at this early stage. - IAN )

Alternatively, one can use an isolated sandboxed network instead of using a
public test-network, which we'll do in the [“Sandbox”](/docs/setup/2-sandbox)
section.

### Try it out
Verify that you can run tezos-client and that it points to test
network:

```
$ tezos-client
Warning:

                 This is NOT the Tezos Mainnet.

     The node you are connecting to claims to be running on the
               Tezos Alphanet DEVELOPMENT NETWORK.
          Do NOT use your fundraiser keys on this network.
         Alphanet is a testing network, with free tokens.

Usage:
  tezos-client [global options] command [command options]
  tezos-client --help (for global options)
  tezos-client [global options] command --help (for command options)

To browse the documentation:
  tezos-client [global options] man (for a list of commands)
  tezos-client [global options] man -v 3 (for the full manual)

Global options (must come before the command):
  -d --base-dir <path>: client data directory
  -c --config-file <path>: configuration file
  -t --timings: show RPC request times
  --chain <hash|tag>: chain on which to apply contextual commands (possible tags are 'main' and 'test')
  -b --block <hash|tag>: block on which to apply contextual commands (possible tags are 'head' and 'genesis')
  -w --wait <none|<int>>: how many confirmation blocks before to consider an operation as included
  -p --protocol <hash>: use commands of a specific protocol
  -l --log-requests: log all requests to the node
  -A --addr <IP addr|host>: IP address of the node
  -P --port <number>: RPC port of the node
  -S --tls: use TLS to connect to node.
  -R --remote-signer <uri>: URI of the remote signer
  -f --password-filename <filename>: path to the password filename
  -M --mode <client|mockup>: how to interact with the node

```

Now that we know we are on a test network we can temporarily disable this
warning so that we don't see it with each command.

```shell
$ export TEZOS_CLIENT_UNSAFE_DISABLE_DISCLAIMER=yes
```

## Create Test Wallets

> With tezos-client installed we can now make a couple of test wallets.

- Go to the [faucet](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/).
- Complete the captcha and download the wallet in the form of a .json file.
- The file name is the wallet address (also known as the public key hash, or
  PKH) with a .json extension.  
- If you look inside the file you will see a property called pkh which contains the address.
- The public key hash is used to identify the account on the Tezos block chain
  and can be though of as an address or account number.
- Next we'll activate the account, passing it the path to the `.json` wallet we
  just downloaded
- We'll first create an account for Alice, then Bob, so we can perform some test
  transactions.
- Don't be alarmed by the blank `Error:` we'll explain why shortly.

```shell
$ tezos-client activate account alice with ~/Downloads/tz1QLne6uZFxPRdRfJG8msx5RouENpJoRsfP.json
Node is bootstrapped, ready for injecting operations.
Operation successfully injected in the node.
Operation hash is 'oog2gMSBNWWTgHujoKViJaCed4wq27gPnLpHKQ27C5savX9ewAq'
Waiting for the operation to be included...
Error:
  
```

> Note empty `Error:` message at the end of the output. `tezos-client` attempts
> to wait for operation inclusion but the public Tezos node we are using
> disallows access (as a security measure) to the part of node api that is
> necessary for this functionality. We use `--wait none` throughout these
> tutorials to avoid this error. If you use your own local Tezos node you can
> omit `--wait none`, the error won't happen.

Make a variable for Alice's account address  (PKH) (notice that the address
is the same as the name of your faucet `.json` file):

```shell
$ ALICE_ADDRESS="tz1QLne6uZFxPRdRfJG8msx5RouENpJoRsfP"
```

Ensure that the activation was successful:

```shell
$ tezos-client get balance for $ALICE_ADDRESS
56828.546322 ꜩ
```

Now, we'll create a new wallet for Bob so we can do some test transactions in
the next section.

- Go back to the [faucet](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/) and download a second wallet
```shell
$ tezos-client activate account bob with tz1ZQYMDETodNBAc2XVbhZFGme8KniuPqrSw.json
$ BOB_ADDRESS="tz1ZQYMDETodNBAc2XVbhZFGme8KniuPqrSw"
$ tezos-client get balance for $BOB_ADDRESS 
```
